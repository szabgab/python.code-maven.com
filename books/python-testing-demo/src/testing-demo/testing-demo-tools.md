# Testing tools

Python has several libraries that help you writing and running automated tests.
`doctest` and `unittest` come with python so they are part of the "standard libraries" of Python, but they are somewhat limited in their features.

`pytest` is a much feature-rich library with lots of extensions. In the recent years it became the de-facto standard for writing and running tests in Python.


In these examples we are going to see these 3 Python modules that can be used for testing.


* doctest
* unittest
* pytest
