# How do you test your code?


This mini-series is for people who don't have the time to delve into the way you'd write tests for your Python code,
but would like to get a quick overview of the possibilities.

However, before we can get into actually testing things, it is worth to think about the following questions:


## What kind of application do you test?

* Web application?
* Command line application?
* Desktop application?
* Batch jobs?
* ...

## How complex is your environment?

* An applications can be a single executable that works locally on the command line.
* Another application might need 2 database and 10 other services to be running.

## What is the goal of the tests?

* Help with development?
* Help verify that the product does what it is expected to do.
