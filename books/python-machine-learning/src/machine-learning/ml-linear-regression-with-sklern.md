# Linear regression with sklearn

In this example we use some generated data to give a basic feeling.

In the first Jupiter Notebook file we see how we can train a model:

* **examples/ml/basic_linear_regression.ipynb**


Then we have two files, one using Jupyter notebook, one a plain Python file demonstrating how
we can use the model.

* **examples/ml/use_basic_linear_expression.ipynb**

{% embed include file="src/examples/ml/basic_linear_regression_predict.py" %}
