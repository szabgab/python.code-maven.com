# Unsupervised Learning

* Clustering (Divide by similarity)


Models are trained on unlabeled data and must discover structure on their own.

* We don't have the right answer for the data set.


## Customer Segmentation
* X:
    * Purchase frequency
    * Average order value
    * Product categories
    * Visit patterns
* y:
    * Groups such as "high-value", "occasional", "price-sensitive"

## Email categorization
* X: Take a bunch of emails and create groups of messages. We can later name those groups (e.g. work, friends, family, marketing, spam, etc.)

* News items
* DNA sequences how much certains Genes are expressed
* Social network analysis
* Market segmentations
* Astronomical data analysis
* Cocktail party algorithm (separating two voices as recorded by two microphones)  (Noise cancellation)
