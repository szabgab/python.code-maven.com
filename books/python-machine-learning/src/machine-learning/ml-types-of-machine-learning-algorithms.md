# Types of Machine Learning algorithms

* Supervised
* Unsupervised
* Reinforcement Learning (RL)

----

* Semi-Supervised Learning (aka. Weak supervision) - uses some labeled data and some unlabeled data.
* Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) - self-supervised models generate implicit labels from unstructured data.
* Self-Supervised Learning
