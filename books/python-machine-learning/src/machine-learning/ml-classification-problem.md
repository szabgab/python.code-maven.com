* Brest Cancer:  Tumor size (x). Is it malignant or benign (y)? Two distinct possibilities. Given a tumor (and its size) what is the probability that it is malignant?
* The Tumor size is a "feature". In other problems we might have many more features.
* e.g. We might know the tumor size, the age of the patient, the gender of the patient, etc.


## Iris species
