# Evolution of programming

* Transistors: `on` or `off`.
* Logical ates: and/or/not  (knitted together).
* we called such an on/off device a  `bit`.
* punchcards (hole or no-hole)
* 0 and 1 values
* More complex instruction represented by numbers betwenn 0-255 that represented by 8 bits we called a byte. (2^8 = 256). `Assembly`.
* Languages such as `C` that can be translated to the lower level instructions using a `compiler`.
* Higher level languages such as `Python` using an `interpreter` - it is like a simultanios translator.
* Writing human(ish) language - `AI`.

* We still need to learn how to talk to it so it will do what we want.
* We need to know what we want.
