People studying Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Life Sciences and a whole lot of other sciences will have a lot of need in processing and analyzing the data they collected.
This involves a lot of manual work, but plenty of this can be automated. There are many ready-made applications that can handle some of the computations, but there are even
more that need special treatment.

This course was designed to be given at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/) in Rehovot, Israel.
It includes a basic Python course with specific extensions for scientific computational needs. It also touches other areas of
programming that can help scientists to use software the best possible way they can.

The recordings include clarifying questions and the solution of the exercises by [N贸ra Doleschall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nora-doleschall/).

The slides used during the recording are available [here](/slides/python).

<h3>Projects</h2>

At the end of the Bootcamp each student is required to work on a project of their own. After they are done with the project some of them agreed to have video recording in which they
explain their project and we discuss the code. These videos are here for your enjoyment and to give inspiration of what you can do after the bootcamp.

* [Basic modification of Biological data frames using Pandas](/bootcamp-shelley-klompus) by Shelley Klompus
* [Managing jobs in a PBS cluster using Python](/managing-jobs-in-a-pbs-cluster) by Oz Mendelsohn
* [Command line accounting in Python](/command-line-accounting-in-python) by Olga Tapinova
* [Getting started with Git and GitHub](/getting-started-with-git-and-github-on-windows) with Olga Tapinova
* [Fixing elevation data in gpx file](https://he.code-maven.com/fixing-elevation-data-in-gpx-file) by Nathan Weinstein (Hebrew)
* [Getting started with Git and GitHub](https://he.code-maven.com/creating-project-on-github) with Nathan Weinstein (Hebrew)

<h3>What to watch and in which order to watch?</h3>

The videos are in the order we recorded them. They are more-or-less along the lines of the chapters, except at the beginning where some chapters are split into multiple videos and some
videos contain parts from multiple chapters.

* There are timestamps on this page pointing you where each sections starts.
* Many sections contain discussions about solving the exercises. I think they can be very useful after you solved the respective exercise, but you can learn the material without them too.
* Part 40 is towards the end, but it can give you a lot of background about programming so you might want to watch it early.
* The Tk video (Part 30) is extra, you don't necessarily need it to complete the course.
* The PyCharm chapter is Part 34, but you might want to watch it earlier, maybe as soon as after Part 10, and then switch to use PyCharm instead of Notepad++
* The Jupyter notebook is Part 42, you might want to watch it earlier. Maybe before SciPy in Part 37.
