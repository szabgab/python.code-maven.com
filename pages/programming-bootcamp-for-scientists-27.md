* 14:39 Relative paths (Why is the directory called 'bin'?
* 16:30 Absolute path and why it is not a good practice
* 18:45 Back to the relative path and explaining how it works (os.path.join, os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, __file__)
* 24:13 Mentioning modules in directory hierarchy (submodules) but not showing them. Since then, there is already a slide with that example.
