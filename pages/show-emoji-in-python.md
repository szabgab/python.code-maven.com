Tons of web site and applications allow the use of Emoji.
There is even an [Emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) to show the available Emojis.
[Wikipedia explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) that some of the Emoji were standardized as
Unicode characters.


There is a Python module, surprisingly called [emoji](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji) that allows
us to include Emoji in Python based applications.  A simple example would look like this:

{% include file="examples/python/show_emoji.py" %}

And the output looks like this:

```
Python is üëç
Python is üç™
```
