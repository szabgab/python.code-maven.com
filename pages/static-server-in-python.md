When I've started to work on the [Code And Talk](https://codeandtalk.com/)
site I did not know what I was building.  I actually started out by collecting data about podcasts.
I did not use a database but I wanted to have some kind of a display.

So instead of creating a dynamic site I opted for a static site that can be generated by a
script and a few templates.

Such site can be served using Apache or Nginx, but on my development machine I don't have either of those.
So I wrote a small web server serving the static files.


{% include file="examples/python/static_server.py" %}
